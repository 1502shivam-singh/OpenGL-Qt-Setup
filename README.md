# OpenGL-Qt-Setup

Boiler-plate code to create a modern OpenGL powered application in Qt5

This code creates a application in which we can change color of an OpenGL created rectangle, by setting uniform values.  
This application can be scaled according to need to create something that can actually use the power of Computer graphics.
